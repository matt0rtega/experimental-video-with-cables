# Experimental Video with Cables.gl

**Workshop duration:** 3 hours

Cables is a visual and code based programming tool for creating interactive content. It allows users from beginner to advanced levels to incorporate processes that are normally limited to people with programming backgrounds. In this workshop, we will be exploring how we can use cables to think visually and generate sequences of images that incorporate characteristics like randomness, animation, sound generated images, and post processing.
